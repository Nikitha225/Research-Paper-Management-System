          The Network Simulator for Quantum Information using Discrete events
          (NetSquid) is a software tool for the modelling and simulation of
          scalable quantum networks developed at QuTech. The goal of NetSquid is
          to enable scientists and engineers to design the future quantum
          internet as well as modular quantum computing architectures.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          One of NetSquid’s key features is its ability to easily and accurately
          model the effects of time on the performance of quantum network and
          quantum computing systems. This forms an essential ingredient in
          developing scalable systems which require a design that can mitigate
          the limited lifetime of quantum bits processed by quantum devices.

            Figure 1 depicts the block-level representation of components in
            NetSquid for the entanglement of two nodes in a network. Such as for
            entanglement, it requires two nodes. Let us consider.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              As the source node, Node A consists of the Quantum Source
              component, which generates qubits, and Quantum Processor, which
              performs quantum operations. By default, a quantum processor
              consists of Quantum Memory which stores the qubits in its memory.
            </li>
            <li>
              Similarly, Node B, as the destination node, consists of Quantum
              Processor (includes Quantum Memory).
            </li>
            <li>
              Node A and Node B are connected using Connection, an abstract
              communication link between nodes. Under the hood, it consists of
              either a Quantum or Classical Channel. In the case of
              Entanglement, it consists of Quantum Channel.
            </li>
            <li>
              4. So, the entanglement is performed between nodes by generating
              two qubits entangled by Quantum Source at Node A and sending one
              qubit from its qout0 port to

        <h2>Teleportation in NetSquid</h2>
        <div class="section-desc">
          <p>
            In Figure 2, a block diagram of quantum teleportation has two nodes,
            Node A and Node B connected by Classical and Quantum Connections.
            Where Quantum connection acts as a Quantum Source to generate qubits
            and send them to both nodes, the Classical channel in Classical
            connection transfers classical bits from Node A to Node B for
            recreating the original qubit.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Initially, Node A has a qubit that wants to transfer to Node B.
            </li>
            <li>
              Quantum Source at Entanglement connection generates entangled
              qubits and transfers the qubits to Quantum channels C2A and C2B
              from ports qout0 and qout1 respectively.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once quantum channels receive the qubits, they transfer the qubits
              from receive ports to Entanglement Connection output ports A and
              B. Then Qubits are transferred to Node A and Node B to their ports
              port_ac and port_bc, respectively.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once Node A receives a qubit at its input port, it stores it in
              Quantum memory via the qin1 port. Similarly, Node B also stores a
              qubit in its respective memory.
            </li>
            <li>
              Now Node A measures with a qubit that it wants to transfer to Node
              B with the newly arrived entangled qubit and transfers the
              measurement in the form of classical bits via the Classical
              channel.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hence teleportation is achieved by transferring classical bits
              from the cin_alice output port to A port of Classical connection,
              connection input port to Classical channel send input port to recv
              port, followed by connection’s B output port to cout_bob input
              port at Node B.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once Node B receives Classical bits, it performs correction on its
              newly arrived entangled qubit to get the original qubit.

            Figure 3 describes the Purification protocol in which the fidelity
            between two entangled nodes improves by performing distillation and
            purification sub-protocols. The working mechanism is as follows.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Initially, Node A has Quantum Source to generate entangled qubits
              and a Quantum processor to store qubits in its memory.
            </li>
            <li>
              First Quantum Source at Node A generates qubits and stores one
              qubit in Quantum memory from its qout0 port to Quantum memory qin0
              port. It sends another entangled qubit from its qout1 port to Node
              A external port port_name_a to Entanglement Connection input port
              A.
            </li>
            <li>
              Inside Entanglement Connection. It transfers a qubit from its
              input port A to Quantum Channel’s input’s send port to the
              output’s recv port to Entanglement Connection’s output port B.
            </li>
            <li>
              From Entanglement Connection’s B port; a qubit is transferred to
              Node B’s port_name_b input port to Quantum memory qin0 input port.
            </li>
            <li>
              Node A performs local measurement and transmits the message to
              Node B via a classical channel inside a classical connection, as
              shown in Figure 3 Purification.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the local measurement at Node A is the same as the local
              measurement at Node B, then the Success signal is sent; else Fail
              Signal is sent, and the Entanglement process is repeated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hence all the steps are repeated until the entanglement is
              successful and local measurements are equal in the Filtering
              sub-protocol; Fidelity is above a certain threshold in the
              Distillation sub-protocol.

            Purification protocol is used to achieve Purification in Quantum

          <ul>
            <li>
              Initially Node A and Node B in Figure 3 Purification, won't have
              the entangled qubits and entanglement generation happens when
              input signal is Wait or Fail.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hence Wait signal is generated at Node A then Quantum Source
              generates entangled qubits and shares each between Node A and Node
              B.

            Repeater protocol is a process of achieving long distance
            entanglement with the help of repeater nodes as an intermediate in
            between source and destination nodes. This is achieved as follows.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Consider three nodes Node A, Node R and Node B as source, repeater
              and destination nodes respectively.

            <li>
              Node A and Node B has both Quantum source and Quantum
              Processor(also memory) and Node R has only Quantum processor.
            </li>
            <li>
              Node A and Node R are connected by Entanglement Channel and
              Classical Channel, similarly between Node R and Node B.
            </li>
            <li>
              Initially, Node A and Node B generates Entangled qubits and stores
              one of qubits in its respective memory locations via respective
              ports.
            </li>
            <li>
              Second qubit at Node A transfers to Node R via Quantum
              Channel(A->R) in Entanglement Connection Similarly, Node B
              transfers to Node R via (B->R) Quantum Channel as show in Figure 5
              Repeater.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once qubits reached Node B, they stores in qin0 and qin1 ports at
              Node R, Purification protocol takes place at each node( either
              Distillation or purification sub-protocol)
            </li>
            <li>
              Then Node R performs measurement on two qubits(similar to
              teleportation), then transfers the classical bits to Node B.

            <li>
              Node B performs correction and sends success signal, then if Node

              Initially, Node A, Node R and Node B dont have entangled qubits,
              waiting for Wait or Fail signal to generate entangled qubits.
            </li>
            <li>
              So, Wait signal is sent to both Node A and Node B, then they
              generate qubits at respective nodes and transfers pair to Node R.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once Node R receives qubits from both nodes, then four nodes
              performs Purification protocol (either Distillation or
              Purification).
            </li>

              Once Purification is success at Node R, it performs measurement on

            </li>
            <li>
              Then Node B performs correction and sends the Success signal.
              Hence if Node A and Node B signals are success then overall
