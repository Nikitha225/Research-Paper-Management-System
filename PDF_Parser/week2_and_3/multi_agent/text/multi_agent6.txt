time interval is depicted in Fig. 9, and the total average
delay is illustrated in Fig. 10. The results illustrate that
total average delay decrease from more than 50 s for ﬁxed
time scheduling to approximately 15 s for the proposed
method.

The reward received from the neighbor and weighted func-
tions of neighboring agents are factors learning algorithm.
These parameters are fuzziﬁed through a FIS. Also, the
number of vehicles in each street is measured and fuzzi-
ﬁed to be used in decision-making process. The simulation
results were compared with ﬁxed time method and other
intelligent methods. The results revealed that our proposed
method achieves considerable reduction of average delay in
intersections.

7 Conclusion

In this study, an intelligent control method of a controlling
trafﬁc network was performed to decrease average delay
time. Each trafﬁc light is considered as a learning agent.
This paper proposed a structure for the agents. Each agent
learn to decide on the duration of green phase through a
fuzzy Q-learning algorithm which is modiﬁed by Game the-
ory. Each agent receives a reward from neighbor agents.
