geted toward the mobile cloud servers. The scope 
of these threats may range from data replication 
to HTTP and XML DoS (HX-DoS) attacks. For the 
network- based mobile security threats, poten-
tial attacks include Wi- Fi sniffing, DoS attacks, 
address impersonation, and session hijacking.

On the side of MEC, the main security con-
cerns  are  in  the  context  of  cloud-enabled  IoT 
environment as well as the open APIs through 
which developers and creators serve contents to 
MEC applications and end users. The need for 
open APIs in MEC is mainly to provide support 
for federated services and interactions with dif-
ferent providers and content creators. However, 
the adoption of open APIs often create vulnera-
bilities through which adversaries in the form of 
third parties can launch various attacks on the 
MEC environment. This has triggered research on 
relevant security technologies channeled toward 
the security of the MEC nodes, which include the 
MEC server and other IoT nodes. Popular threats 
in this landscape are DoS attack, man-in-the-mid-
dle (MitM) attack, malicious mode problems, pri-
vacy leakages, and VM manipulation. A broad 
description of the threat landscape in MEC is pre-
sented in [11], in which the authors cover a wide 
array of potential security threats for the MEC sys-
tem and also why security is one of the greatest 
challenges of MEC.

Privacy Challenges in 5G
From the user’s perspective, the major privacy 
concerns  could  arise  from  data,  location,  and 
identity. Most smartphone applications require 
details of subscribers’ personal information before 

Redundant or multiple 
controllers may solve the 
challenge of controller 
availability or increase 
resilience to security 
attacks. However, miscon-
figuration of forwarding 
elements or inter-federat-
ed conflicts due to multiple 
controllers will hinder 
network-wide security 
policy enforcement.

the installation. The application developers and 
companies rarely mention how the data is stored 
and  for  what  purposes  it  is  going  to  be  used. 
Threats such as semantic information attacks, tim-
ing attacks, and boundary attacks mainly target 
the location privacy of subscribers. At the physi-
cal layer level, location privacy can be leaked by 
access point selection algorithms in 5G mobile 
networks. International Mobile Subscriber Identity 
(IMSI) catching attacks can be used to reveal the 
identity of a subscriber by catching the IMSI of the 
subscriber’s user equipment (UE). Such attacks 
can also be caused by setting up a fake base sta-
tion that is considered as the preferred base sta-
tion by UE which has lost access to a Temporary 
Mobile Subscribers Identity (TMSI); thus, the sub-
scriber will respond with their IMSI [12]. More-
over, 5G networks have different actors such as 
virtual mobile network operators (VMNOs), com-
munication service providers (CSPs), and network 
infrastructure providers. All of these actors have 
different priorities for security and privacy. The 
synchronization of mismatching privacy policies 
among  these  actors  will  be  a  challenge  in  the 
5G network. In the previous generations, mobile 
operators had direct access and control of all the 
system components. However, 5G mobile opera-
tors are losing full control of the systems as they 
will rely on new actors such as CSPs. Thus, 5G 
operators will lose full governance of security and 
privacy. User and data privacy are seriously chal-
lenged in shared environments where the same 
infrastructure is shared among various actors (e.g., 
VMNOs and other competitors). Moreover, there 
are  no  physical  boundaries  of  5G  networks  as
