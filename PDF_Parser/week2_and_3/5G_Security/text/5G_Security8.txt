Novel security solutions 
need to be sought out 
that use the development 
in, for example, artificial 
intelligence and context 
awareness, to enable pro-
active network forensics 
and response leveraging 
the programmability 
enabled by SDN and run-
time, yet, need-based 
security service insertion 
in various network perim-
eters using NFV.
