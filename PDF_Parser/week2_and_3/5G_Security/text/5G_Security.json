By connecting all aspects of life, 5G aims  at a digital society that requires high service avail- ability and security using a diverse set of technolo- gies.

For example, multi-tenant shared cloud  infrastructures among multiple virtual network  operators require strict isolation at multiple levels  to avoid illegal resource consumption and main- tain integrity of users’ information of different  operators [2]. According to the 5G-PPP Phase  1  Security  Landscape  [1],  network  slicing  has  several open security challenges such as security  isolation of network slices and security of inter- slice communications [3]. Moreover, program- mable network architectures like SDN require  strong authentication and authorization for appli- cations to avoid misuse of the network resourc- es exposed to applications through the control  plane. Similarly, misconfigurations of virtual net- work functions (VNFs) can lead to inter-feder- ated  conflicts  creating  jeopardy  in  the  whole  network [4].

Furthermore, this depen- dence on the controller requires the control-data  planes channel to be resilient to security attacks  unlike the current optional use of security proto- cols and long restoration delays in large networks.  Redundant or multiple controllers may solve the  challenge  of  controller  availability  or  increase  resilience to security attacks. However, misconfig- uration of forwarding elements or inter-federated  conflicts due to multiple controllers will hinder  network-wide security policy enforcement [4]."

One of  the main challenges persistent in the use of NFV  in mobile networks is the dynamic nature of VNFs  that leads to configuration errors and thus security  lapses [8].

Moreover, private deployments of NFV are vul- nerable only to malicious insiders (e.g., a mali- cious administrator), since remote access to the  system is prevented.

Usually, phys- ical network devices are installed and configured  by a trusted employee, and there is established  trust of the device. However, because VNFs fetch  dynamically from the cloud, some level of trust  mechanism is needed to prevent malicious VNFs.  Further challenges are highlighted in Table 1."

MEC, on the  other hand, comprises different complementary  technologies interoperating in an open ecosystem  where virtualization and distributed computing  are harnessed by service providers to deploy and  serve applications to end users. Given that MEC  is relatively in its infancy, coupled with the diver- sity of MEC technologies, there is potential for  malicious attacks and privacy issues. Since MEC  extends cloud computing capabilities to the edge  of mobile networks, the level of protection that  can be offered to the edge hosts is low compared  to  what  is  obtainable  in  traditional  large  data  centers. Similarly, in multi-tenant cloud networks  where tenants run their own control logic, inter- actions can cause conflicts in network configura- tions. Mobile cloud computing (MCC) migrates  the  concepts  of  cloud  computing  into  the  5G  ecosystems.  This  creates  a  number  of  security  vulnerabilities  that  mostly  arise  with  the  archi- tectural and infrastructural modifications in 5G.  Therefore, the open architecture of MCC and the  versatility of mobile terminals create vulnerabilities  through which adversaries could launch threats  and breach privacy in mobile clouds [10]."

Threats such as semantic information attacks, tim- ing attacks, and boundary attacks mainly target  the location privacy of subscribers. At the physi- cal layer level, location privacy can be leaked by  access point selection algorithms in 5G mobile  networks. International Mobile Subscriber Identity  (IMSI) catching attacks can be used to reveal the  identity of a subscriber by catching the IMSI of the  subscriber’s user equipment (UE). Such attacks  can also be caused by setting up a fake base sta- tion that is considered as the preferred base sta- tion by UE which has lost access to a Temporary  Mobile Subscribers Identity (TMSI); thus, the sub- scriber will respond with their IMSI [12]. More- over, 5G networks have different actors such as  virtual mobile network operators (VMNOs), com- munication service providers (CSPs), and network  infrastructure providers. All of these actors have  different priorities for security and privacy. The  synchronization of mismatching privacy policies  among  these  actors  will  be  a  challenge  in  the  5G network. In the previous generations, mobile  operators had direct access and control of all the  system components. However, 5G mobile opera- tors are losing full control of the systems as they  will rely on new actors such as CSPs. Thus, 5G  operators will lose full governance of security and  privacy. User and data privacy are seriously chal- lenged in shared environments where the same  infrastructure is shared among various actors (e.g.,  VMNOs and other competitors).

We believe that new  technologies such as SDN and NFV can solve  these challenges more cost effectively. SDN has  the capability to enable runtime resource (e.g.,  bandwidth)assignment to particular parts of the  network as the need arises. The SDN control- ler can gather network stats through the south- bound API from network equipment to see if  the traffic levels increase. Using NFV, services  from the core network cloud can be transferred  toward the edge to meet the user requirements.  Similarly, NFV enables the provision of virtual  slices or resources at runtime to meet the grow- ing traffic demands or surges in traffic at differ- ent network locations."

The proposed  architecture  provides  security  not  only  to  the  virtual functions in a multi-tenant environment,  but  also  to  the  physical  entities  of  a  telecom- munication network. Using trusted computing,  remote verification and integrity checking of vir- tual systems and hypervisors is proposed in [15]  to provide hardware-based protection to private  information and detect corrupt software in virtu- alized environments. In NFV systems, sophisticat- ed security protection solutions such as firewalls  and IDSs can be used to prevent outside attacks.  Moreover,  identity  and  access  management  mechanisms (e.g., role-based access control) can  be used to mitigate the impact of insider attacks.  Infrastructure-level  attacks  can  be  prevented  by continuous monitoring of the resource con- sumption of each user and preventing malicious  requests according to a blacklist of IP addresses."

Hence, virtualization comes as a natural option  for securing cloud services since each end node  connects to a specific virtual instance in the cloud  via a virtual machine (VM). Security is provided  through the isolation of each user’s virtual connec- tion from other users. Virtualized in-cloud security  is one such virtualization solution to secure MCC.  For specific security threats such as HX-DoS,  specific  solutions  such  as  learning-based  sys- tems  (e.g.,  [16])  are  more  useful  than  generic  approaches. For example, learning-based systems  take a certain number of samples of packets and  analyze  them  for  various  known  attributes  to  detect and mitigate threats."

For 5G security standardization,  the NGMN P1 WS1 5G security group is mainly  gathering requirements and providing their sug- gestions. In January 2016, the SA3 group [3] of  3GPP started working to standardize the 5G secu- rity aspects and provide contributions to 5G-PPP  initiated projects.

We have also presented the poten- tial security mechanisms and solutions for those  challenges. 5G still has to be deployed; thus, the  security challenges in these technologies and their  solutions will become more vivid. However, the  integration of IoT seems to raise more security  concerns, specifically in terms of privacy. There- fore, novel security solutions need to be sought  out that use the development in, for example, arti- ficial intelligence and context awareness to enable  proactive network forensics and response lever- aging the programmability enabled by SDN and  runtime, but need-based security service insertion  in various network perimeters using NFV."
